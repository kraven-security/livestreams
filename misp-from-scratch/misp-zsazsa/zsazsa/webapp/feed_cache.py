"""On-disk cache of rendered indicator feeds.

A feed can be given a caching interval. The first request for it runs the query
once, writes the result in every format the feed is served in under
data/feed_cache, and serves those files until the interval has passed. A SOC
polling the feed URL then reads a file instead of sending zsazsa back to MISP
on every pull.

The cache is per feed, not per query: editing a feed drops it, so the next
request runs the new query.

Usage:
    from webapp import feed_cache
    feed_cache.interval(feed)          # "hourly" / "daily" / "weekly", or ""
    feed_cache.read(feed, "json")      # cached body, or None if it must run
    feed_cache.last_copy(feed, "json") # what was written last, however old
    feed_cache.write(feed, bodies)     # {format: body}, for a cached feed
    feed_cache.written_at(feed)        # unix time it was cached, or None
    feed_cache.clear(feed_uuid)        # after an edit or a delete
    feed_cache.failure(feed)           # why the last refresh did not work
    feed_cache.refresh_due()           # from the analyser run
